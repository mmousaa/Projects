- Created Pivot Tables for monthly, regional, and product-level insights

- Visualized the KPIs using Excel Pivot Charts and conditional formatting

- Developed an interactive dashboard with slicers (Region, Segment, Category, Year)

- Implemented KPI cards for quick snapshot metrics

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights
- Dog Care Dominates â€“ This category significantly outperformed others in sales, indicating strong market demand.

- High-Income Buyers Drive Revenue â€“ This segment generated the highest sales, suggesting premium product opportunities.

- PC is the Primary Sales Channel â€“ Desktop purchases led transactions, highlighting the need for a PC-optimized sales experience.

- Mid-Year & Year-End Peaks â€“ June and December showed the highest sales, ideal for targeted promotions.

- Undisclosed Ownership = Higher Spend â€“ Transactions with unspecified ownership had slightly higher average sales, warranting further investigation.

## âœ… Final Conclusion
To maximize sales performance, focus on high-demand categories like Dog Care and tailor strategies for high-income buyers. Capitalize on peak seasons (June/December) with targeted promotions, and investigate undisclosed ownership transactions to uncover hidden opportunities. Streamlining these priorities will drive revenue growth and operational efficiency.
